# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BANK_DATA_ANALYSIS

I completed a comprehensive Bank Data Analytics project in collaboration with UNP, where I analyzed real-world banking data to understand customer behavior, financial performance, and key operational indicators. The primary aim of this project was to transform raw and unstructured bank data into meaningful insights that can support strategic decision-making. The dataset included detailed information such as customer demographics, account types, transaction records, account balances, and loan details. I used Microsoft Power BI to perform data cleaning, transformation, and data modeling to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. I created calculated columns, measures, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate important metrics such as total balance, loan distribution, customer segmentation, and account performance. This process helped in identifying trends, patterns, and relationships within the data. I developed an interactive and visually appealing dashboard to present the insights in a simple and understandable manner. The dashboard enables users to monitor customer distribution, analyze financial trends, and evaluate overall bank performance efficiently. It allows stakeholders to explore the data dynamically and gain valuable insights for better planning and decision-making. Through this project, I gained practical experience in data analysis, data visualization, and dashboard development using Power BI. It enhanced my skills in data cleaning, data modeling, and interpreting real-world financial datasets. This project also strengthened my understanding of business intelligence concepts and improved my ability to present data-driven insights effectively.
